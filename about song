“Yesterday” is the most covered song in history, with over 2,000 versions having been recorded. A spare, haunting song of lost love from the early Beatles catalog, it was sung perfectly by a young Paul McCartney.

McCartney dreamed the entire melody before he arranged the music with George Martin. According to Rolling Stone:

‘It fell out of bed,’ Paul McCartney once said about the origins of ‘Yesterday.’ ‘I had a piano by my bedside, and I must have dreamed it, because I tumbled out of bed and put my hands on the piano keys and I had a tune in my head. It was just all there, a complete thing. I couldn’t believe it. It came too easy.’
